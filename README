The implementation used the starter code (solution to A1).

In my implementation, when exec is given only 1 file of script to execute, then exec 
will call run to execute this script. Because for whatever scheduling policy given,
the output will be the same.

I used linedklist of pcb to perform the task for readyQueue, but during the setting up
of the readyQueue, arrays of pcb are also used to help generate the readyQueue, but 
the execution of scripts is done by readyQueue itself.

The code to be exec/run will be separated into pages and saved in directory called
backingstore, which will be created during the runtime, and will be removed when 
mysh exits without error.

The implementation of demand paging and LRU is pased on the index of stored page in 
memory. Each pcb keeps track of its total page, total lines of code, current page,
current index in frame. There is a pagetable for each PCB to know where the 
designated page is stored in memory or not(-1 means not yet, non-negative number
indicates where the index of this page starts in the memory).
